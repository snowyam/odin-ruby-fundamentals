# Advanced Building Blocks

### Project 1: Bubble Sort

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldn't it?). Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array but accepts a block. The block should take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared. Expect that the block's return will be similar to the spaceship operator you learned about before -- if the result of the block is negative, the element on the left is "smaller" than the element on the right. 0 means they are equal. A positive result means the left element is greater. Use this to sort your array.

### Project 2: Enumerable Methods

Implement Ruby's handy built-in iterator methods.
* each
* each_with_index
* select
* all?
* any?
* none?
* count
* map
* inject
